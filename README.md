# Adaptive-Priors-for-Burstiness-Analysis-in-Topic-Modeling-with-Generalized-Dirichlet-Distributions

Abstract:
Topic modeling is a powerful tool with wide-ranging applications, and many models have been developed and used over the years. However, most of these models have a common weakness: they do not account for the burstiness of word usage. This phenomenon, where a word is more likely to be used again once it appears in a document, is a key feature of natural language. In this paper, we present a new topic modeling approach that integrated Generalized Dirichlet and Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) distributions to explicitly model word burstiness while accommodating diverse and adaptable patterns of topic proportions. Our experimental results on various text datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed model compared to existing baseline models, achieving better perplexity and coherence scores.
